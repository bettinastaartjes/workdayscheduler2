2ND ATTEMPT
This assignment asked us to create a daily planner that could create a schedule using time blocks for standard business hours. The current day is displayed at the top of the page and the time-blocks are color coded to show whether they are in the past, present, or future. You can enter an event and save it to local storage in JS.
